@oauth-everything/oauth2-types
=========================

This package provides helper types for @oauth-everything OAuth 2.0 strategies.
If you are using this in a project directly, you should save it as a dev dependency
(`--save-dev`). If you are using this in a library you will need
to save it as a regular dependency - otherwise it won't be included for consumers
of your library and their typescript builds will complain.

## Instalation
```bash
npm install @oauth-everything/oauth2-types
```

## Usage
```ts
import * from '@oauth-everything/oauth2-types';
```
